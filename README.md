# Stuff


My collection of stuff, simple scripts to make my life easier, the tmp monitor was for my Rpi3 as i ran kali on it.
These are very basic starting off kinda shit :-)

This is mainly a collection i like to save, but also i like to improve them and move to their own repo maybe.

## Bash Scripts
1. cpu-tmp.sh as i said above but i still find it useful on my bare bones etc
2. get-xfce.sh was forked to help with my headless installs Rpi etc
3. start-tor.sh simple starter script i wrote to start tor, save me typing all the commands, lazy.
4. tx-power.sh forked to boost tx power of wi-fi adaptor
