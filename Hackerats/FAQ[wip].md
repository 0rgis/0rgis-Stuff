## Monster fights
Battle monsters, as you die, you lose nothing but you also gain nothing. As you win you might gain great riches! Beat the cheese, eat the cheese and farm the cheese!
Monster fights force you to research certain topics without showing you any hints. Your damage and HP are both based on your EXP. If you are in a battle already and want to start a new one, quit your current on first! Health and damage are bound per battle for future reasons.
Everytime you do damage, you gain karma and if you beat a monster, an item!
